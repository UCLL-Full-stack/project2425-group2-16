# Black Bazaar

Description: the Black Bazaar is the ideal game browsing and purchasing platform for hardcore gamers. In here, users will be able to browse their beloved games (including a filter option to search a desired game), and check out various features like a description for each game, type of game, and average rating given by other users. All games can be purchased - no wallet mechanic in the website, only direct purchase through secure vendor. Users can also make an account and then add games to their "favorite" list, which can be accessed from their profile, along with a list of purchased games.
